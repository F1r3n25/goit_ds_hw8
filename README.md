<ul>
  <li>Fill in the gaps in the code.</li>
  <li>Train the neural network.</li>
  <li>Build the necessary graphs.</li>
  <li>Find the network losses.</li>
  <li>Test the network on the test data.</li>
  <li>Derive quality metrics for each class of trained model using https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.classification_report.html</li>
  <li>Draw conclusions</li>
</ul>
